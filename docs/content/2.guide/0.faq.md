description: Frequently asked questions about ESLint integration in Nuxt
---

This project is composed of multiple packages for different level of ESLint integration.

### What to use?

For new projects, we highly recommend using the [ESLint Module](/packages/module) which provides a project-aware ESLint flat config and being future-proof.

If you still use the legacy `.eslintrc` format, you can use the [ESLint Config](/packages/config) package to manually configure your ESLint settings. We would recommend you to migrate to the flat config format if possible.

If you are maintaining your custom ESLint config and want a low-level setup, you can use the [ESLint Plugin](/packages/plugin) package enable some Nuxt-specific rules to your config.

### Packages Disambiguation

Due to the historical reasons, we have quite a few packages for different ESLint integration.

Here's a table to help you understand the differences:
